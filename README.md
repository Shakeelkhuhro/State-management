# Redux Counter App

This is a simple counter application built using React and Redux. It demonstrates how to manage state using Redux in a React application.

## Introduction to Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps in managing the state of your application in a centralized manner, making it easier to understand, debug, and test.

Redux follows a unidirectional data flow pattern, where the state of your application is stored in a single immutable object called the "store". The store is updated using pure functions called "reducers", which take the current state and an action as input and produce a new state as output.

Redux provides a way to dispatch actions, which are plain JavaScript objects that describe what changes should be made to the state. These actions are handled by the reducers to update the state in a predictable and controlled manner.

In a React application, Redux is commonly used in conjunction with the `react-redux` library, which provides bindings between Redux and React components.
